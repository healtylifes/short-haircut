<p>Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries. Hair that is wavy when wet but dries straight is naturally wavy hair that is being weighed down or stretched out. If your hair goes back and forth from side to side like an S shape or in a loose corkscrew shape then your hair is wavy. If your hair is on the borderline between straight and wavy humidity can make it wavy while on days where the air is more dry it will act straighter.

<p>So what could happen here is that you may very well have that curly hair gene but until it is somehow activated you wont see curls or waves. All my life really. Kinky curls are the smallest in width yet densest in thickness. After months of CGM my hair got curly in the front and wavy in the back.
