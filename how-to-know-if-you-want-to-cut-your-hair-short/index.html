<p>When you have shorter hair that means you dont need as much color to dye it. You can cut your hair at the nape of your neck for a short and stylish bob or trim just a bit off of your ends if you want to grow out your short hairstyle. You might be questioning how you would look with short hair if you can pull off daring pixies or shags or if youd even know how to style a bob. Dont have a cut in winter. Pin On Hair Beauty.</p>
