<p>The origin of K-Pop케이팝keipap-an abbreviation of Korean popular music or Korean Pop actually goes back to the early 1990s when the trio 서태지와 아이들seotaejiwa aideul changed the music scene with their experimental music which combined traditional and foreign music elements and started to flourish in 1996 when the five member boy band HOT. The story of how I found K-pop is somewhat sad. One day I was insecure about my appearance and searched up female k-pop idols to compare myself to them. First song Ive ever heard was Gee and Ive seen people talk about groups like U-Kiss Shinee 2NE1. Pin On Stray Kids.</p>
