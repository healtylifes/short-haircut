<p>The origin of K-Popì¼ì´íkeipap-an abbreviation of Korean popular music or Korean Pop actually goes back to the early 1990s when the trio ìíì§ì ìì´ë¤seotaejiwa aideul changed the music scene with their experimental music which combined traditional and foreign music elements and started to flourish in 1996 when the five member boy band HOT. The story of how I found K-pop is somewhat sad. One day I was insecure about my appearance and searched up female k-pop idols to compare myself to them.
