<p>Starting by visiting a professional is your best bet and if you feel comfortable enough to try it on your own at home afterwardgo for it. Lighter hair can make you look younger as long as you use the right tones. The best part about layers and bangs is that they work for any type of hairstyle from long locks to shorter styles. If you go darker you probably wont like what you see in the mirror. Pin On Brown Hair Trends.</p>
