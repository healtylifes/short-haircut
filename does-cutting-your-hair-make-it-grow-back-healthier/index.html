<p>Realistically trimming can only help you maintain healthy hair. Its high maintenance because you need to be doing this multiple times a week since the hair pretty much grows back within a couple days. It will also not help against hair loss or make it grow faster. Problem is if you cut back on washing in an effort to spare your hair you can actually make the problem worse. Pin On Alopecia.</p>

<p>So while cutting your hair wont make it grow faster it will ensure that the length you have is strong and beautiful rather than wispy and damaged. When you ru b fingernails briskly against each other for about 10 minutes every day it stimulates hair growth and makes your hair healthy and strong. Hair growth rate is unaffected by regular haircuts color or styling. In fact having damaged hair removed does not in any way alter anyones genetic growth cycle. Pin On Hair And Beauty.</p>
