<p>Typically men should get a haircut every two to three weeks but if youre doing a tight fade or something similar that needs extra detail every two weeks should more than do the trick. But because we have to keep it short we really need to have a hair cut more often than you do. I get my hair cut every 3 weeks. I let my hair get shaggy until it starts requiring more than a few swipes of a brush to get in order. 39 Hilarious Expectation Vs Reality Pics That Will Make You Lol Wackyy Hair Fails Expectation Vs Reality Haircut Fails.</p>

<p>In 1980 I cut my hair and donated it because a very good friend of mine died of cancer. It really depends on the style you want and frequency of cut you need to maintain it. If you often throw your hair up in a messy bun because you dont have the time to deal with it tell the stylist that so they can create a cut thats easy to manage. If your goal is beard shape maintenance youll want to cut it every 3-4 weeks. Reddit The Front Page Of The Internet Beard Shapes Mens Facial Hair Styles Faded Beard Styles.</p>
