<p>Layering removes the extra bulk in your hair and enhances hair volume and movement. Your stylist can mask the portions of your hair that are thinning with portions that are still fairly thick. Your problem is probably that you hair is too long. Long layers create more texture and movement in your hair helping to take the focus away from thinning. With fine hair especially if the hair has thin density the decision to add layers to build volume depends on whether or not there is any curl or wave to the hair and how much.</p>
