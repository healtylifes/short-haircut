<p>The standard bob cut exposes the back of the neck and keeps all of the hair well above the shoulders. And for a few years now I have had it short and spiky. Then my best friend requested me to try this product As he knew I was trying to grow my hair and in 3 months of using the new grow serum I have thick hair my hair feels soft shiny and amazing my hair growing beautifully and am so proud I found this product thanks best friend and thanks just natural product for inventing something so magically I cant wait to see how much my hair. Also be careful cutting your hair radically short when you have children under 12 years. Pin By Holly Orange On Hair Ideas Short Hair Styles Hair Styles Bob Hairstyles For Fine Hair.</p>
