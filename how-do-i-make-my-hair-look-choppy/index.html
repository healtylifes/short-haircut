<p>Opt for a shorter cut if you have thin limp hair. Choppy ends make the hair look a little messy but stylish at the same time. Drawing hair is considered one of the hardest areas for any artist even to some professionals. If you prefer longer hair to short styles keep your cut on the lengthier side with a chic pixie bob.

<p>Make sure you keep it all one length going higher at the nape can look a little dated Blessed with curls. I dont look older I look better. I lived at tge beach and didnt ever have to worry about my hair looking messy. If your hair is on the thinner side one sneaky way to make it look fuller is to add some volume to the crown.

<p>Jul 27 2014 Hey all I got my hair cut again which I wanted but afterwards I realised the hair cut is still quite feminine I couldnt really request a boys hair cut due to present circumstances. Make sure you sit down with your hair stylist before you go in for the chop. Straight hair is best when it comes to pulling off the emo look so make sure you have a decent hair straightener easily at hand if your hair is naturally frizzy or curly. With plenty of layers and tousled finish a shag haircut is great for short to medium hair and while itll look great on thick hair this cut is especially great for those with fine hair which lacks volume and movement.
