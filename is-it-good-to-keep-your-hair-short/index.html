<p>Short hair grows quick and if you dont like the color you can just cut it once it grows out. The shorter your hair is the more lift it will appear to have. As someone whos had two pixie haircuts in the past I can say that once the initial shock has worn off maintaining the cut is the most difficult part. This kind of hair is the best in the summer.

<p>If you like having the flexibility to throw your hair back in a ponytail every now and again a shorter style might just not be for you. In fact I dont think anyone should have their haircut dictated to them particularly not because of something as arbitrary as age. Fine straight hair tends to look flat when you wear it long. If you are a short person avoid long hair past your shoulders as that will make you look shorter and it will make your neck visually disappear said. Pin On Shawty.</p>
