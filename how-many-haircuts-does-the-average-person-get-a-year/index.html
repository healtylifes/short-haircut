<p>6 of answers mention An average hair cut for a week if i worked 5-6 days would very but if i had to put a number i would say anywhere from 75-100 in a good busy week. I used to go less often but not to the point of every having hair extend to shoulder length a cousin diddoes though. It turns out the optimal amount of time between haircuts on average is 3 to 6 weeks. This may sound like a lot of money but I live in Dallas Texas.
