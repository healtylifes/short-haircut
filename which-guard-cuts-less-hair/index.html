<p>A Grade 1 Haircut is about 18 of an inch which is a little longer than a number zero. Barbering clippers usually have adjustable length settings on the permanent blade guard and have removable length guards that allow the user to cut the hair to a uniform short length quickly and easily. However we do not recommend a number 1 cut if you dont want your scalp to show. When the taper lever is closed it cuts more hair and the blade is at its lowest cutting position.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see how the 14-inch blade was still cutting lots of hair even after using the 14-inch clipper comb. 1 will bring it down pretty close to the scalp and 5 leaves just enough hair that you dont. With the 4 size you can start to get a brush or crew cut which are similar to a buzz cut but include a skin fade on the sides and longer hair on top. Buzzed with guard-less clippers this cut is similar to a shaved haircut but without any shaving involved. Traditionally the buzz cut is done with no guard on the clippers and the hair is cut to be the same length all over.</p>

<p>A Number 0 Haircut has no guard attached and therefore uses the permanent guard attached to the clipper for a short cut. 1 Guard Very Short.
