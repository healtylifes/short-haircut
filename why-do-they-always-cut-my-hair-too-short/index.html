<p>Short hair can help turn that beautiful baby face into a stone-cold adult. I just cant imagine myself being sexually attracted to her like that. Last night she said she wants it cut super short. This is what it should say minus the middle part. Pin On Short Hair Styles.</p>

<p>As a professional hairdresser here are my two cents and a little ranting mixed in First of all to everyone who seems to be flabbergasted about how often she highlights her hair who are you. Hairdressers dont actually hate long hair it is just a lot harder to maintain and most of us usually take it for granted. If the client is trying to grow-out his or her hair the objective shifts and the hair is carefully trimmed so that the ends are even our hairs grow independently at varying rates of growth. Also sometimes hair textures are looser when wet and tighter when dry.
