<p>When doing a double shampoo you definitely want to use a really moisturizing conditioner on the ends otherwise itll cause your hair to feel crunchy. Women with lighter skin tones tend to stay away from this dark hair color because it washes them out. Their shades are what can be considered as cool tones. Putting harsh chemicals and bleach on natural hair can be hugely destructive which can alter the texture and health of each individual strand. This will make it static-y once it dries.</p>
