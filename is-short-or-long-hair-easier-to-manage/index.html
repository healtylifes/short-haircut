<p><strong>Is Short Or Long Hair Easier To Manage</strong>, Im in the long camp mostly because Im totally lazy and when my fine hair is. For some who straighten everyday having short hair is low maintenance because they dont have to straighten as much. Short hair is easier to maintain Since shorter hair can appear to take less effort than longer hair it is easy to get the impression that short hair is a more manageable length to maintain than long hair. But short hair requires more appointments for trims and often more types of styling products than longer hair does.</p>
