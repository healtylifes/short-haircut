<p>Perm may give absolutely magical results for the women who love to have curly or wavy hair every day. Given that it cant really handle deep layers and given that you can achieve the same spiral or loose curl look with a curling ironby starting your curl near the root spinning the curling iron once and dragging the iron in that position down to the tip of your hair in the same manner as a flat iron Id have to say that this unit is actually less flexible than a regular curling iron. Use it to pick out your roots and the lengths of your hair for a boost in volume. Also the direction of the curl. You may not have known this but even those with a loose curl pattern will sometimes opt to get a perm in order to reinforce their curls and add even more.</p>
